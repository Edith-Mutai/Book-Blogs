            <h3>Freedom, Love, and the Cages We Build</h3>
            <p><i>In Born a Crime, Trevor Noah writes, “Abel wanted a traditional marriage with a traditional wife… but he never fell in love with subservient women… </i>'He only wants a woman who is free because his dream is to put her in a cage.'” This quote sharply reveals a contradiction still seen in modern relationships: the desire for freedom-loving women — but also the urge to control them.

                Today’s society loudly advocates for women’s independence, ambition, and self-expression. Yet, many relationship expectations haven’t evolved at the same pace. Some men still find strong, opinionated women attractive — but struggle when those women refuse to be controlled or silenced. The idea of wanting someone because of their freedom, only to later suppress it, is a painful irony still alive.
                
                We see examples everywhere. In workplaces, women who lead confidently are often labeled "bossy" or "difficult." In personal relationships, ambitious women are sometimes criticized for not being “nurturing enough.” Even popular culture often romanticizes the "taming" of the "wild woman" trope.
                
                Personally, I’ve noticed how society sometimes applauds free-spirited women — as long as their freedom doesn’t threaten traditional power dynamics. True love, however, should never involve cages. It should be a partnership where both people grow freely, not a constant struggle for dominance.
                
                Trevor Noah’s mother, Patricia, embodies this fierce independence. Her refusal to be caged is what kept her spirit alive — even in the most dangerous circumstances. Her story reminds us that real love celebrates strength, not stifles it.
                
                In today’s world, we must question: Do we truly love people as they are — or are we trying to turn them into something safer for ourselves?
